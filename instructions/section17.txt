*** Setup Redux & Redux ToolKit

- Install: npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

- Implement Redux Store to store menuItem in app
 + Export the RootState type in store.ts which used for TS purpose

- Go to Root level index.tsx to set up Provider for React Redux

- Use Redux Query to fetch api
 + Create menuItemApi inside Apis folder to use Redux Query Api

- When we register the Api, make sure to add that in middleware
 + Default configuration needed

- First, we fetch data from Api using Redux Toolkit
 + Then, we'll be able to set & save data into Redux Store

- Remember to return Loading Component when Api is loading data

- Load MenuItem Detail
 + Use useParams from ReactRouter to actually get {id} from url 
 + Work on manage Quantity of item
